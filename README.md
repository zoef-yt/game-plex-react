# Homepage

On homepage/landing page you can see the intro video of the video library(demo video for now). You can see a search bar which will take you to the search page. You can see a icon on the header of the app which will let you change the theme of the app. You can hover over the circular icon to see more options. When you scroll down you can see all the categories of videos. Hover over it to see the button to go to the video listing page with the selected category(will be there in future update). The app approach is also mobile first so you can see the app on any device(still needs testing).
