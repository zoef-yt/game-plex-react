# Homepage

On the homepage/landing page, you can see the intro video of the video library(demo video for now).

You can see a search bar that will take you to the search page.
You can see an icon on the header of the app which will let you change the theme of the app.
You can hover over the circular icon to see more options.

The app approach is also mobile-first so you can see the app on any device(still needs testing).
